Academic Honesty Pledge
========================

Cal Poly PHYS 202 - Spring 2013

I have read and understand the rules regarding academic honesty and I agree to abide by them.
I pledge on my honor that I have not given or received any unauthorized assistance on assignments or ex-
or examinations in this course.

Instructions:
-------------

Open the file, and run all the cells between "Simulation" and "Multilateration" markdown cells at least once.

You may want to run the very last one before the "Multilateration" to check and see if you have good data. Open "time_intervals.dat" in a notebook editor to see if you have enough trial runs.

Then run all the cells beneath "Multilateration" and hopefully my code is finished by then.
